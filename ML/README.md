# Machine Learning Section

To do：

1. Firstly spilt out small datasets （those with more than 10 metastasis samples)
2. Use the whole small dataset to do PCA and differential expression analysis using different formula, note the results.
3. Split the dataset into training and validation parts, then to balance the data? (select one or two datasets)
4. Do cross-validation on training part
5. Be familiar with machine learning workflow! Know more algorithms and mathematics behind them
