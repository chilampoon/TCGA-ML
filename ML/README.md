1. Firstly spilt out small datasets (those with more than 10 metastasis samples) -- done
2. Use the whole small dataset to do PCA and differential expression analysis using different formula, note the results.
- The PCA... I don't know how to scale the RNA-seq data and how to plot?
- If correct the gender and race, the q-vals are even higher in BRCA
- Though the protein coding genes are not differentially expressed in BRCA, the non-coding RNAs do. 
2-1. Do the all gene set for those 11 cancer types -> gold bar plot
2-2. Choose some genes and plot some barplot in BRCA 
2-3. Use the RNAs to plot heatmap in BRCA?

3. Split the dataset into training and validation parts, then to balance the data? (BRCA and HNSC) Follow Christine's script!

4. Do cross-validation on training part
5. Be familiar with machine learning workflow! Know more algorithms and mathematics behind them
